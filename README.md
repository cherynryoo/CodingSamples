This is code from a project I worked on under Professor David Cesarini during the summer of 2024. I replicate the findings and figures of the Fleche et al. paper titled "The importance of capital in closing the entrepreneurial gender gap: A longitudinal study of lottery wins". 
I include the original paper and a brief write-up comparing my replication to the original paper.
